# Fingerprint-Based-Access-Control-System-for-College-Events
This project is a biometric access system for college events that uses a fingerprint sensor, Arduino, Python, and a web dashboard to enroll and verify students. It automates entry, prevents duplicates, stores data in JSON, and provides fast, secure, real-time event management.
